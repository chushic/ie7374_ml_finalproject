# ie7374_ml_finalproject

This is a final project of a machine learning course at northeastern university, by Chushi Chen, Weikun Zhuang, Binghui Lai, and Ziwei Duan.

We did this classification task using logistic regression, Naive Bayes, Kernel SVM without using sci-kit learn. Also, we built a simple neural network using Tensorflow. See [project report] (https://github.com/chushic/ie7374_ml_finalproject/blob/master/Group%208%20pre.pdf)https://github.com/chushic/ie7374_ml_finalproject/blob/master/Group%208%20pre.pdf) for detailed informationã€‚
